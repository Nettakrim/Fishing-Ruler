## Fishing Ruler
*Ever wanted to fling an entity really far with a fishing rod, but you keep snapping your line due to the distance? Well now you can!*

Fishing Ruler adds an indicator above the hotbar when using a fishing rod showing the current length of the line

Since the distance you can pull entities is proportional to the length of the line, this means you can easily maximise how far you fling something!

...More usefully, the color of the text can tell you information about fishing - like whether the water source is large enough to fish up treasure, or changing color for a second whenever a fish bites your hook, so you know when to reel in

The possible text colors are:

If you ever forget what a color means you can use `/fishingruler:help` to display the above message in-game
